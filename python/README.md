# Deep Learning "from scratch" in Python
Closely following https://course.fast.ai/part2, the aim is to develop a deep learning library using jupyter notebooks.

The notebooks are being numbered to reflect stages in which the library is built. I plan to refactor code by making a new notebooks, to retain a nice record of the development process.

### Log:
*__28/06/2020__ - Wrote a script to export code from jupyter notebooks into a python modules in a systematic way.*

*__29/06/2020__ - Created some small testing functions and familiarized self with fastai.datasets module.*

|  Notebooks  |  Features  |  Working  |
|-------------|:----------:|:---------:|
| *00_exports*  |  • Turn code from jupyter noteboooks to python modules  |  ✓ |
| *01_testing* | • Tests based on some comparable (supplied as a function argument). | ✓ |
| Low Priority |
| *- 01_datasets* | • All the required functionality from fastai.datasets | ✗ |
