# Deep Learning in Python
Closely following https://course.fast.ai/part2, the aim is to develop a machine learning library using jupyter notebooks as a development environment.

The notebooks are being numbered to reflect stages in which the library is built. I am yet to see whether I will do any refactoring by going back and changing notebooks, or making a new one to keep the old code for the record.

### Log:
*__28/06/2020__ - Wrote a script to export code from jupyter notebooks into a python module in a systematic way.*
